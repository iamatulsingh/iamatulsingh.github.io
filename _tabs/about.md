>Hey there! I’m just your average human who believes that life is a grand adventure on two wheels and a quest for high scores. When I’m not zooming around on my bike pretending to be in the Tour de France, you can find me saving virtual worlds from pixelated doom. 🚴‍♂️🎮
I have a knack for finding the best coffee spots (because every hero needs their fuel), and I can probably tell you more about bike gears and game strategies than you ever wanted to know. If you ever need a partner for a bike ride or a co-op game, I’m your person. Just don’t ask me to choose between the two – that’s like asking a parent to pick their favorite child!
